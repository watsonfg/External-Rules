# External-Rules
Watson Furniture Autodesk Inventor External Rules

This is a repository of the existing and new external rules (rules outside of the per model process rule) that function as the shared code base for Watson Furniture Group. 

The majority of this code base was produced between 2010 and 2020, but with no revision or archiving control. The git creation is a effort to provide these benefits as the codebase grows.
